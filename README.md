# Money-and-Fame

A Flutter project designed to help users effectively manage and monitor budgetary allocations. This application serves as a versatile financial companion, providing users with a user-friendly interface to track and analyze spending habits among housemates, couples, or individuals. I adopt codes and take inspiration from many sources to quickly build the app to serve my purpose and personal usage. Hope you find the app useful :purple_heart:!

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You'll need to install Flutter SDK on your computer before downloading this project.<br>
Link to Flutter in Github: https://github.com/flutter/flutter<br>
Link to Flutter's website: https://docs.flutter.dev/
### Installation
Create or go to your project folder. Paste `git clone https://github.com/DucAnh-Vu-Trinh/Money-and-Fame.git` to your terminal.
## Usage
### As developer
The lib/CustomWidgets folder has all the major Widgets in the app, aiming to make it easier for you to reuse the code.<br>
There are 3 pages (screens) in the app:
* First page use ListView.builder and Card Widgets to create a dynamic list of items (a list that can change in length)
* Second page utilizes a flutter template that I found on the web
* Third page (summary_page) also uses ListView.builder and Card Widgets to build a list of Card widgets. The item in the ListView can be filtered by the Switch Widget in the Drawer Widget using the Visibility Widget
